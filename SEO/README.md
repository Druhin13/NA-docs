### 1. Page Title Tags

Page titles play a vital role in SEO. They should be concise (typically 50–60 characters, including spaces) and accurately represent the content of each page. Implementing dedicated CMS items for Title tags in CMS page templates can streamline this process.

```markdown
<!-- Example Page Title Tag -->
<title>Home | Your Website</title>
```
<br>

### 2. Page Descriptions

Page descriptions offer a brief summary of a page's content. Craft informative and engaging descriptions (50–160 characters, or up to 300 characters, including spaces). Consider using dedicated CMS items for Description tags in CMS page templates.

```markdown
<!-- Example Page Description Tag -->
<meta name="description" content="Explore our latest products and services.">
```
<br>

### 3. OpenGraph Image

Enhance your website's social media presence by incorporating OpenGraph images. These images dictate how your pages appear when shared on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

```markdown
<!-- OpenGraph Image Tag -->
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/images/og-image.jpg">
```
<br>

### 4. URL Length

Keep your page URLs short, meaningful, and user-friendly. Ensure that auto-generated URLs for CMS page templates also adhere to these principles.

Example of a well-structured URL: https://example.com/about-us <br>
Example of a 'not so' well-structured URL: https://example.com/read-this-entire-blog-talking-about-us-how-we-work

<br>

### 5. Duplicate Content Avoidance

Prevent duplicate content issues by using the no-index meta tag where necessary. This helps avoid the indexing of similar or redundant pages.

```markdown
<!-- No-Index Meta Tag -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">
```
